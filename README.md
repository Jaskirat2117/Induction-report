# Day 1: 31st July,2025
Beginning of a day of new hopes, happiness on our faces and spiritual blessings. We began our day with sacred blessings of God and a hope to live a life full of joys, happiness and obstacles too. All my collegemates belonging to different branches gathered at the College Gurudwara to take the blessings of the Divine. Then we got our seats accommodated at the auditorium to listen the enthusiastic and encouraging words of wisdom from our chief guest Mr. Ravinder Garg, Chief Engineer of Municipal Corporation of Ludhiana, Dr. Sehijpal Singh, Principal of GNDEC and our respected HODs of different departments. Then, Mr. Ashok Singla gave us some information about financial literacy and told us about various programmes or policies introduced by the government to support education of students without any kind of financial stress.This ceremony was a very exciting ceremony to make us be encouraged to perform good in our academics as well as in different activities. Further, we went to our respective departments to get familiar to the environment of the college buildings and classrooms. Hence, we got the opportunity to interact with different professors. We also got to know about the different programmes and subjects being evaluated in our college. We were also introduced with different clubs and societies in the college to be a part or member of. It was an informative day full of various type of information about different activities.
